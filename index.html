      States of Matter

      Have you ever wondered what water is? Or what an ice cube is? Have you ever learned about the fifth state of matter?
      Well if not, then find out more here!
      So, before we get started, we have to find out what matter even is. Matter is made up of atoms, and matter is anything that takes up space. Your house, your water, and even yourself, is all matter.
      Ok, now moving on to our first state of matter, a solid. A solid has a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Ice cubes, paper, tables, and your own computer are all solids. In other words, they have their
      own shape, and don't need anything to be held in, and the atoms inside are closely packed, giving the solid its own shape. Unlike our next state of matter, which is liquid. Liquids are basically something
      that have fixed volume but absolutely no fixed shape. The atoms inside are relatively close, but they're pretty seperated and not as packed as a solid. Liquids basically take the shape of whatever their
      container is, but if on a flat surface, it's just a splat. Examples of this is your water, your saliva, plasma in your blood, and vinegar! The atoms, again, are relatively close, unlike our next state of matter: gas.
      In gases, the atoms inside are separated and they move rapidly, free to go wherever they can. But solids can stop them. Take helium for example. It's a gas that can go freely, but if you use it to fill a balloon,
      then it's there to make it float. Gases have no fixed shape or volume. Gases can include carbon dioxide, steam, mist, and helium. Learning about gases can also help with our second-to-last state of matter: plasma.
      Plasma is basically a superheated gas, and it's the oldest state of matter in our universe. The atoms act like gas, but again, they're more heated than usual. Examples of plasma include lightning, a part of the Sun, which is primarily made of plasma,
      and superheated fires. Now let's move on to one of the coldest states of matter, a very new state of matter, and our last one. Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter that can reach up to nearly absolute 0, or 0 kelvin, or -273.15 degrees celsius.
      The original idea came from Albert Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose from 1924 to 1925. They didn't have the equipment required for Bose-Einstein condensate, so back then, even though the theory was there, there wasn't really any Bose-Einstein condensate.
      However, in 1995, Bose-Einstein condensate was made by scientists Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman with rubidium atoms. Later in the year, a scientist named Wolfgang Ketterle made Bose-Einstein condensate with sodium atoms.

      Hopefully, this article gave you a glimpse of what your everyday objects around you could be. Hopefully you learned about the fifth state of matter.
      There are 22 states of matter out there, but this article discusses the five most commonly discussed states of matter. You could also learn about
      phase changes, basically meaning how matter changes its state. Just click on the link on the science homepage called "Phase Changes" to learn about them.
