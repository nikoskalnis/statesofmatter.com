      Have you ever wondered what water is? Or what an ice cube is? Have you ever learned about the fifth state of matter?
      Well if not, then find out more here!
      So, before we get started, we have to find out what matter even is. Matter is made up of atoms, and matter is anything that takes up space. Your house, your water, and even yourself, is all matter.
      Ok, now moving on to our first state of matter, a solid. A solid has a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Ice cubes, paper, tables, and your own computer are all solids. In other words, they have their
      own shape, and don't need anything to be held in, and the atoms inside are closely packed, giving the solid its own shape. Unlike our next state of matter, which is liquid. Liquids are basically something
      that have fixed volume but absolutely no fixed shape. The atoms inside are relatively close, but they're pretty seperated and not as packed as a solid. Liquids basically take the shape of whatever their
      container is, but if on a flat surface, it's just a splat. Examples of this is your water, your saliva, plasma in your blood, and vinegar! The atoms, again, are relatively close, unlike our
